# 5th Java Project

Project 5 is a program written to keep track of student records.  You can create new students and compare them. 
You can also display one studentâ€™s records or all of them. This project taught me how to use arrays, how to create 
Classes and Objects of those classes, and how to use JOptionPane.

This project was done for my 1st Intro to Computer Science Class
